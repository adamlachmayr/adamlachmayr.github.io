Star Wars The Rise of Skywalker at the box office Jason Guerrasio Dec 11 2019 400 AM facebook twitter reddit linkedin Email Sony Jumanji The Next Level is the sequel to the 2017 boxoffice hit Jumanji Welcome to the Jungle The movie avoids a sequel slump by adding new characters and implementing some more videogame elements And all praise goes to the movies scene stealer a horse Visit Business Insiders homepage for more stories Jumanji Welcome to the Jungle was one of the biggest boxoffice surprises of 2017 as Sonys sequel to the 1995 Robin Williamsstarrer brought in close to US1 billion at the worldwide box office That was shocking not just because the decadesold franchise found a second life but because it held its own against Star Wars The Last Jedi which was released at the same time Now Sony is hoping history will repeat itself this holiday season Jumanji The Next Level in theatres Friday brings us back into the video game with a brandnew mission and new characters to root for In Welcome to the Jungle the movie ends with the highschool seniors who were sucked into the game Spencer Alex Wolff Martha Morgan Turner Fridge SerDarius Blain and Bethany Madison Iseman winning their mission and destroying the game once they are back in reality The Next Level picks up as the now best friends return home for the holidays from college Everyone is excited to catch up except Spencer Hes overwhelmed at NYU doesnt know where he stands with Martha the two fell in love while in the game and he is nowhere as confident in life as the avatar he played in the game Dr Smolder Bravestone Dwayne Johnson We find out that Spencer actually kept the broken game and once hes home instead of meeting up with his friends he gets the game working again and is sucked back in His friends go after him as well as Spencers grandfather Eddie Danny DeVito and his friend Milo Danny Glover Quickly we learn that the Jumanji game is not the same as the first time they entered The locations are different and everyone outside of Martha are different characters Shes still Ruby Roundhouse Karen Gillan but Fridge is Professor Shelly Jack Black Milo is Mouse Kevin Hart and Eddie is Dr Bravestone Bethany doesnt make it in the game until later and its in spectacular fashion So director Jake Kasdan has cleared the first hurdle in staying away from a stale sequel hes brought some changes to the existing characters Hart is hilarious playing Mouse in the form of a laid back Danny Glover Johnson is tasked with having to play up the wacky as DeVito which can try your patience at times but for the most part is entertaining But the person who really owns the movie this time around is Gillan whose Ruby Roundhouse has to keep the group on task as they try to find Spencer who is now a new player named Ming Awkwafina and save Jumanji again Like Welcome to the Jungle this one explores selfconfidence and the strength of friendship The action and jokes come at you fast and often especially when Bethany gets in the game along with Alex played again by Nick Jonas and its revealed her character is a horse Praise to Jumanji horse Its kind of a scene stealer the rest of the movie Sony is going a different route this time with Jumanji releasing it a week before Star Wars The Rise of Skywalker In 2017 Welcome to the Jungle came out the week after Last Jedi Clearly the studio is confident the movie can hold its own and it should play well as a counter to people who arent into Star Wars or as a choice for people after going to see Rise of Skywalker The movie has already earned over US50 million internationally I was a big fan of Welcome to the Jungle and had no idea how a sequel could match how entertaining that was But Kasdan along with screenwriters Jeff Pinkner and Scott Rosenberg found some creative ways to keep things fresh by implementing more game elements adding some new characters and trusting that the strength of the existing cast would hold Its a lot of fun

critic Matt DeCristo is joined by new writer Kaari McBride as they discuss Star Wars Episode 1 The Phantom Menace as well as the trailer and upcoming Star Wars film The Rise of Skywalker They talk about their favorite scenes the story and what it was like to catch the film in the theatre back in 1999 The Star Wars saga has seen a lot of changes over the years and its hard to imagine a franchise that started in 1977 and had a revival in 1999 with Menace could still be unconcluded as we near 2020 George Lucas would revolutionize both sound and FX in his original film A New Hope but The Phantom Menace would give him a whole new world to play with Lucas saga hosted more side characters and introduced a plethora of actors who would go on to famed roles see Harrison Ford Carrie Fisher that make
